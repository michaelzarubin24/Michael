                Tether (often referred to by its currency codes, USD₮ and USDT,
                among others) is an asset-backed cryptocurrency stablecoin. It
                was launched by the company Tether Limited Inc. in 2014. Tether
                Limited is owned by the Hong Kong-based company iFinex Inc.,
                which also owns the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange. As of July
                2022, Tether Limited has minted the USDT stablecoin on ten
                protocols and blockchains.Tether is described as a stablecoin
                because it was originally designed to be valued at USD $1.00.
                Tether Limited has stated that it maintains USD $1 of asset
                reserves for each USD₮ 1 issued, but has been fined by
                regulators for failing to do this and has failed to present
                audits showing sufficient asset reserves.

                The company has launched two cryptocurrencies which it developed
                itself: Binance Coin (BNB), and BinanceUSD (BUSD). BNB launched
                July 2017, which started as an Ethereum token and later moved to
                Binance Smart Chain (BSC), launched September 2020. BSC later
                merged with the older Binance Chain and was rebranded into BNB
                chain. BNB Chain operates using "Proof of Staked Authority", a
                combination of proof of stake and proof of authority. It has 21
                approved validators. As of 2021, Binance Coin was the
                cryptocurrency with the third highest market capitalization.
                Binance allows its users to pay fees on its exchange with BNB.
                BNB Chain supports smart contracts and is compatible with the
                Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). There have been multiple
                criticisms of Binance Smart Chain concerning its level of
                centralisation, which had led to several exploits on the
                network.
